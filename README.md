# Alien_Blast
Primary practice project for python

This project is designed to familiarize with Python's language features and how git is used.  
This project has detailed guidance in the book "Introduction to Practice from Python Programming".  
I plan to add some new features to improve its playability after initial completion, and also as a way to test my understanding of it.
